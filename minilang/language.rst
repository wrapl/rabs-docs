Language
========

*Minilang* has a simple syntax, not too different from *Pascal* (although probably closer to *Oberon-2*). Keywords are in lower case, statements are delimited by semicolons ``;``, although these can be (and are usually) omitted at the end of a line. The following is an example of *Minilang* code showing an implementation of the Fibonacci numbers.

.. code-block:: mini

   fun fibonacci(N) do
      if N <= 0 then
         error("RangeError", "N must be postive")
      elseif N <= 2 then
         ret 1
      end
      var A := 1, B := 1
      for I in 2 .. (N - 1) do
         var C := A + B
         A := B
         B := C
      end
      ret B
   end
   
   for I in 1 .. 10 do
      print('fibonacci({I}) = {fibonacci(I)}\n')
   end
   
   print('fibonacci({0}) = {fibonacci(0)}\n')

This produces the following output:

.. code-block:: console

   fibonacci(1) = 1
   fibonacci(2) = 1
   fibonacci(3) = 2
   fibonacci(4) = 3
   fibonacci(5) = 5
   fibonacci(6) = 8
   fibonacci(7) = 13
   fibonacci(8) = 21
   fibonacci(9) = 34
   fibonacci(10) = 55
   Error: N must be postive
      test/test12.mini:3
      test/test12.mini:20

Declarations
------------

All variables must be declared in *Minilang* using :mini:`var`. Variables are visible within their scope and any nested scopes, including nested functions, unless they are shadowed by another declaration. Before assignment, variables have the value :mini:`nil`. Optionally, a variable can be initialized when it is declared. Note that variables can be referenced within their scope before their declaration, but they will have the value :mini:`nil` before their initialization.

.. code-block:: mini

   print('Y = {Y}\n') -- Y is nil here
   
   var Y := 1 + 2
   
   print('Y = {Y}\n') -- Y is 3 here
   
   var X
   
   do
      X := 1 -- Sets X in surrounding scope
   end
   
   print('X = {X}\n')
   
   do
      var X -- Shadows declaration of X 
      X := 2 -- Assigns to X in the previous line
      print('X = {X}\n')
   end
   
   print('X = {X}\n')

.. code-block:: console

   Y =
   Y = 3 
   X = 1
   X = 2
   X = 1

For convenience, functions can declared using the following syntax:

.. code-block:: mini

   fun add(X, Y) X + Y

This is equivalent to writing

.. code-block:: mini

   var add := fun(X, Y) X + Y

Functions themselves are described in :ref:`minilang/functions`.

Expressions
-----------

Other than declarations, everything else in *Minilang* is an expression (something that can be evaluated).

Values
~~~~~~

The simplest expressions are single values. More information on values in *Minilang* can be found in :doc:`/minilang/types`.

Nil:
   :mini:`nil`.
Integers:
   :mini:`1`, :mini:`-257`. Note that the leading ``-`` is parsed as part of a negative number, so that :mini:`2-1` will be parsed as ``2 -1`` (and be invalid syntax) and not ``2 - 1``.
Reals:
   :mini:`1.2`, :mini:`.13`, :mini:`-1.3e5`.
Strings:
   :mini:`"Hello world!\n"`, :mini:`'X = {X}'`. Strings can be written using double quotes or single quotes. Strings written with single quotes can have embedded expressions (between ``{`` and ``}``) and may span multiple lines.
Regular Expressions:
   :mini:`r".*\.c"`.
Lists:
   :mini:`[1, 2, 3]`, :mini:`["a", 1.23, [nil]]`. The values in a list can be of any type including other lists and maps.
Maps:
   :mini:`{"a" is 1, 10 is "string"}`. The keys of a map have to be immutable and comparable (e.g. numbers and strings). The values can be of any type. 



.. _minilang/functions:

Functions
~~~~~~~~~

Functions in *Minilang* are first class values. That means they can be passed to other functions and stored in variables, lists, maps, etc. Functions have access to variables in their surrounding scope when they were created.

The general syntax of a function is :mini:`fun(Arguments) Body`. Calling a function is achieved by the traditional syntax :mini:`Function(Arguments)`. 

.. code-block:: mini

   var add := fun(A, B) A + B
   var sub := fun(A, B) A - B
   
   print('add(2, 3) = {add(2, 3)}\n')
   
.. code-block:: console

   add(2, 3) = 5

Note that :mini:`Function` can be a variable containing a function, or any expression which returns a function.

.. code-block:: mini

   var X := (if nil then add else sub end)(10, 3) -- 7
   
   var f := fun(A) fun(B) A + B
   
   var Y := f(2)(3) -- 5

As a shorthand, the code :mini:`var Name := fun(Arguments) Body` can be written as :mini:`fun Name(Arguments) Body`. Internally, the two forms are identical.

.. code-block:: mini

   fun add(A, B) A + B

The body of a function can be a block :mini:`do ... end` containing local variables and other expressions.

When calling a function which expects another function as its last parameter, the following shorthand can be used:

.. code-block:: mini

   f(1, 2, fun(A, B) do
      ret A + B
   end)

can be written as

.. code-block:: mini

   f(1, 2; A, B) do
      ret A + B
   end

If Expressions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The basic :mini:`if ... then ... else ... end` expression in *Minilang* returns the value of the selected branch. For example:

.. code-block:: mini

   var X := 1
   print(if X % 2 = 0 then "even" else "odd" end, "\n")

will print ``even``.

Multiple conditions can be included using :mini:`elseif`.

.. code-block:: mini

   for I in 1 .. 100 do
      if I % 3 = 0 and I % 5 = 0 then
         print("fizzbuzz\n")
      elseif I % 3 = 0 then
         print("fizz\n")
      elseif I % 5 = 0 then
         print("buzz\n")
      else
         print(I, "\n")
      end
   end

Loop Expressions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Minilang* provides a simple looping expression, :mini:`loop ... end`. This keeps evaluating the code inside indefinitely. The expression :mini:`exit <value>` exits a loop and returns the given value as the value of the loop. The value can be omitted, in which case the loop evaluates to :mini:`nil`.

.. code-block:: mini

   var I := 1
   print('Found fizzbuzz at I = {loop
      if I % 3 = 0 and I % 5 = 0 then
         exit I
      end
      I := I + 1
   end}\n')


The keyword :mini:`next` jumps to the start of the next iteration of the loop.

Note that if an expression is passed to :mini:`exit`, it is evaluated outside the loop. This allows control of nested loops by writing code like :mini:`exit exit Value` or :mini:`exit next`.

For Expressions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The for expression, :mini:`for Value in Collection do ... end` is used to iterate through a collection of values.

.. code-block:: mini

   for X in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] do
      print('X = {X}\n')
   end

If the collection has a key associated with each value, then a second variable can be added, :mini:`for Key, Value in Collection do ... end`. When iterating through a list, the index of each value is used as the key.

.. code-block:: mini

   for Key, Value in {"a" is 1, "b" is 2, "c" is 3} do
      print('{Key} -> {Value}\n')
   end

A for loop is also an expression (like most things in *Minilang*), and can return a value using :mini:`exit`. Unlike a basic loop expression in *Minilang*, a for loop can also end when it runs out of values. In this case, the value of the for loop is :mini:`nil`. An optional :mini:`else` clause can be added to the for loop to give a different value in this case.

.. code-block:: mini

   var L := [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
   
   print('Index of 3 is {for I, X in L do if X = 3 then exit I end end}\n')
   print('Index of 6 is {for I, X in L do if X = 6 then exit I end end}\n')
   print('Index of 6 is {for I, X in L do if X = 6 then exit I end else "not found" end}\n')

.. code-block:: console

   Index of 3 is 3
   Index of 6 is
   Index of 6 is not found
   
Generators
..........

For loops are not restricted to using lists and maps. Any value can be used in a for loop if it can generate a sequence of values (or key / value pairs for the two variable version).

In order to loop over a range of numbers, *Minilang* has a range type, created using the :mini:`..` operator.

.. code-block:: mini

   for X in 1 .. 5 do
      print('X = {X}\n')
   end

::

   X = 1
   X = 2
   X = 3
   X = 4
   X = 5

The default step size is :mini:`1` but can be changed with an additional :mini:`..` call.

.. code-block:: mini

   for X in 1 .. 3 .. 10 do
      print('X = {X}\n')
   end

::

   X = 1
   X = 3
   X = 5
   X = 7
   X = 9

Methods
~~~~~~~

Internally, *Minilang* treats every value as an object with methods defining their behaviour. More information can be found in :doc:`/minilang/oop`. Method names are first class objects in *Minilang*, and can be created using a colon ``:`` followed by one or more alphanumeric characters, or by using two colons ``::`` followed by one or more symbol characters (``!``, ``@``, ``#``, ``$``, ``%``, ``^``, ``&``, ``*``, ``-``, ``+``, ``=``, ``|``, ``\``, ``~``, `````, ``/``, ``?``, ``<``, ``>`` or ``.``). Note that is currently not possible to mix the two sets of characters in a method name.

.. code-block:: mini

   :put
   ::+

Methods behave as *atoms*, that is two methods with the same characters internally point to the same object, and are thus identically equal.
 
Methods can be called like any other function, using parentheses after the method.

.. code-block:: mini

   var L := []
   :put(L, 1, 2, 3)
   print('L = {L}\n')

.. code-block:: console

   L = 1 2 3

For convenience (i.e. similarity to other OOP languages), method calls can also be written with the first argument before the method. Thus the code above is equivalent to the following:

.. code-block:: mini

   var L := []
   L:put(1, 2, 3)
   print('L = {L}\n')

Finally, methods with symbol characters only can be invoked using infix notation. The following are equivalent:

.. code-block:: mini

   ::+(A, B)
   A + B
   
   ::+(A, ::*(B, C))
   A + (B * C)

.. warning::
   *Minilang* allows any combination of symbol characters (listed above) to be used as an infix operator. This means there is no operator precedence in *Minilang*. Hence, the parentheses in the last example are required; the expression :mini:`A + B * C` will be evaluated as :mini:`(A + B) * C`.
